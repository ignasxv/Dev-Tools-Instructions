## Creating and nesting componets
- React apps are made out components
    - **A Component** is a piece of UI that has its own logic and appearence
    - React components are basically JS functions that return markup
        ```ts
        export default function MyComponent(){
            return (
                <h1>This is a Component</h1>
                <AnotherComponent/>
            );
        }

        function AnotherComponent(){
            return (
                <h2>Another component</h2>
            );
        }
        ```
    - *As a convention Componets must always start with a Capital letter, while HTML tags tags must be lowercase*
